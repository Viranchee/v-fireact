# A Login Application flow using React

### Day 1
Watched a Udemy React Course and implemented it.

Then, I designed the Navigation first, and tested out how navigating around the app should feel like.

There's the Login, Home, and Signup page boilerplate code set-up

### Day 2

Writing the actual React Application:

Since this project has to communicate with Firebase, I researched on some Firebase repos. Also going through existing repos was confusing initially.

I read the official docs on React's Concepts, uptill `List & Keys`, and deep diving into some, eg `setInterval` using Hooks.

Time Spent:

Morning hours spent in formatting my MacOS Big Sur and rolling back to stable Catalina.

Afternoon was spent fixing the `.env` file fiasco, which I accidently stored in `/src/.env` and wondering why all the tutorials didn't work. Need some good indentation on VSCode's File Gutter.

### Day 3

1. Plan: Learn `React Forms`, complete the React `Main Concept` Guides

2. ✅ Login Mock

3. ✅ Log In button working: Once login button is clicked, UserName & Password are sent in an Axios request to Firebase. Used [this Firebase Auth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unr4s3jd9qA) tutorial for getting started

4. ✅ [Firebase Hosting Deployed](https://v-react-login-demo.web.app/login)

5. ❌ Deploy with Github Actions

6. 🟠 Capture User Details on Sign Up
