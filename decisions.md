# A Login Application flow using React

### Day 1
Watched a Udemy React Course and implemented it.

Then, I designed the Navigation first, and tested out how navigating around the app should feel like.

There's the Login, Home, and Signup page boilerplate code set-up

### Day 2

Writing the actual React Application:

Since this project has to communicate with Firebase, I researched on some Firebase repos. Also going through existing repos was confusing initially.

I read the official docs on React's Concepts, uptill `List & Keys`, and deep diving into some, eg `setInterval` using Hooks.

Time Spent:

Morning hours spent in formatting my MacOS Big Sur and rolling back to stable Catalina.

Afternoon was spent fixing the `.env` file fiasco, which I accidently stored in `/src/.env` and wondering why all the tutorials didn't work. Need some good indentation on VSCode's File Gutter.

### Day 3

1. Plan: Learn `React Forms`, complete the React `Main Concept` Guides
1. Making Mock UI: âœ… Login Mock
1. Log In button working: ðŸŸ  Once login button is clicked, UserName & Password are sent in an Axios request to Firebase
